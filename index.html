          <p>Based in Cheshire, Agnes Beauty Atelier offers bespoke beauty services from permanent makeup to eyelash extensions and eyebrow treatments. After receiving the branding pack from the client, I developed a minimal and clean design to fit in with the brand. The client wanted a light and to the point design so clients could effortlessly find information without clicking through numerous pages. Although, at the beginning the client was not certain on how the website should look, I      created different mock-ups of websites using different designs to narrow down the options and see which one was the best for the Beauty Salon. Additionally, responsiveness was very important as user ability was a top priority. This led to altering some design features on different screen sizes and devices. For example, making buttons larger, reducing image sizing and layout padding. On completion of the project, I received excellent feedback and fulfilled the client’s brief and expectations. This led to additional work of creating informative graphics for the client’s Social Media channels such as Instagram. As engagement and presence via Social Media is key for small business, I regularly create content on a weekly basis to ensure content is being uploaded on the client’s website daily.
